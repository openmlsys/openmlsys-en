<h2><span class="section-number">1.1. </span>Background<a class="headerlink" href="#background" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In 2020, I joined the School of Informatics at the University of
Edinburgh, which is considered one of the birthplaces of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) research. The university offers machine learning
courses that cover a wide range of topics, including natural language
processing, computer vision, and computational neuroscience.
Additionally, the university is well-known for providing a complete
series of fundamental courses on computer systems, such as operating
systems, programming languages, compilers, and computer architecture.
However, when I asked my students about how computer systems are
utilized to deploy and accelerate computation in machine learning, many
of them appeared puzzled. This led me to contemplate whether the
University of Edinburgh, along with other universities worldwide, should
expand their curricula by adding a course that bridges the gap between
machine learning and computer systems.</p>
<p>Initially, my idea was to expand an existing course. At the time, the
“AI Systems” course at the University of California, Berkeley was
particularly popular. It explored various research directions in machine
learning systems, with an emphasis on studying research papers.
Unfortunately, many of these papers did not stand the test of time, and
the course did not provide a comprehensive architectural overview of the
knowledge. Consequently, students were unable to gain a complete
understanding of the subject or learn how to construct a machine
learning system from scratch. I then looked to other universities, where
I discovered that the University of Washington offered a brief course
called “Deep Learning Systems,” which focused on the compilation process
of machine learning programs. However, the course primarily centered
around Apache TVM, a compiler stack for deep learning systems, and
lacked a systematic introduction to machine learning systems. Stanford
University also had a course in this area, “Machine Learning Systems
Design,” but it focused on topics such as data cleansing, management,
and annotation, as databases were the course designer’s primary
expertise.</p>
<p>In my search for a suitable course, I expanded my scope to Microsoft
Research Asia. Their “AI Systems” course seemed like the closest match
to my expectations at the time, as it elaborated on the design concepts
of machine learning systems. However, as I prepared to teach it to
undergraduates, I realized that it provided only a general introduction
to the core design concepts of machine learning systems and assumed
students had a solid foundational knowledge of computer systems. It was
better suited for doctoral students than undergraduates. In fact, all
the courses I previously mentioned focused on studying research papers
rather than on easily comprehensible textbooks that provide a clear
knowledge map. Consequently, the materials involved in these courses
were filled with scattered ideas, creating significant obstacles for
students attempting to learn about machine learning systems.</p>
<p>On the flip side, 2020 was a year in which we saw the emergence of
excellent course materials, providing fundamental knowledge about
operating systems, databases, distributed systems, and even machine
learning algorithms. However, it remained difficult to find a textbook
that systematically introduces machine learning systems. Many enterprise
and university labs needed to expend significant resources in order to
train students and engineers from scratch and enhance their
understanding of the fundamental architecture of machine learning
systems. The absence of such textbooks presented a huge challenge in
developing academic and industry talent. Against this backdrop, the idea
of writing a textbook on machine learning systems began to take shape in
my mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="beginning">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.2. </span>Beginning<a class="headerlink" href="#beginning" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>When I shared this idea with my friends, they recognized the immense
value of writing such a textbook. However, the preparation and writing
process involved could be a daunting uphill battle. My postdoctoral
mentor advised me to focus on publishing high-impact papers at the
beginning of my faculty career instead of spending significant amounts
of time and energy on a book that may not even be published. Other
professors preferred to revise existing textbooks rather than write new
ones, particularly in the field of machine learning systems, which
evolve rapidly through a process of trial and error. Even if a new book
were published, it may become obsolete quickly due to technological
advancements over time.</p>
<p>Despite encountering several obstacles, the idea of writing a textbook
on machine learning systems did not fade away until I went to China for
a holiday and spoke with Xuefeng Jin, the architect of MindSpore. We
first met in London around Christmas time in 2019 when he was leading
the development of MindSpore 1.0, which had yet to be launched. We
became acquainted through our mutual interest in the development of
machine learning systems. In 2018, I co-built a new machine learning
framework from scratch, similar to PyTorch, with my colleagues. Although
the project ended due to insufficient resources, the experience
motivated me to publish several papers on machine learning systems.
Xuefeng and I both recognized how challenging it was to develop AI
systems and to find experts in machine learning system development.
Students often focused more on machine learning algorithms and had only
a superficial understanding of key system design principles. They did
not realize the significance of these principles until they applied
machine learning technologies in practice, but by that point, it was too
late to learn them. I shared my idea with Xuefeng about writing a
textbook on machine learning systems and anticipated that it might take
three to four years to complete. Xuefeng had a similar idea and asked
whether he could assist in any way.</p>
<p>Xuefeng’s offer was enlightening. I started asking myself: why not break
the conventional pattern of book writing, which follows the chronicle of
discipline development over years by one or two professors. This pattern
is similar to the waterfall model in traditional software development,
but with technological advancements, software development has evolved to
open-source agile development. Therefore, why should book writing follow
the outdated approach? A good example of this is the
<a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">:raw-latex:`\emph{Deep Dive into Deep Learning}`</span></a> book, compiled by the
MXNet open-source community. I immediately invited Hao Dong, an
assistant professor at Peking University and co-founder of the
TensorLayer open-source community, to collaborate with us. Excited about
this prospect, Xuefeng invited his colleague, Zhiliang Gan, to join us.
We were committed to creating a new textbook and finally settled down to
writing.</p>
<p>After several rounds of discussion, we named the book <strong>Machine Learning
Systems: Design and Implementation</strong>. Our intention was to introduce the
time-tested design principles of machine learning systems and share a
wealth of system implementation experience, so that students could learn
how to analyze and solve problems in future work and scientific
research.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="community-building">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.3. </span>Community Building<a class="headerlink" href="#community-building" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Since the field of machine learning systems is an evolving discipline
that continually nurtures a variety of research subjects, I pondered how
to create an author community to ensure the book’s sustainability. As my
research expertise focuses on large-scale software systems, I chose to
build a community by referencing several key design points of
distributed systems, as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Prevention of single-point failure or bottleneck:</strong> Modern
distributed systems are typically designed to separate the control
plane from the data plane to avoid single-point failure or
bottleneck. To ensure the sustainability of the book, we decided to
follow this approach and design a highly scalable writing community
using a distributed mechanism. The editor spent most of their time
searching for excellent, proactive, and responsible chapter owners.
Chapter owners then collaborated with other authors to facilitate
writing progress on a per-chapter basis, communicating with chapter
authors about writing details and adhering to given deadlines. The
editor and chapter owners had weekly meetings to synchronize writing
progress and ensure that chapter content met the overall expectations
of the editor and the community in terms of quality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Iterative improvement:</strong> The stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
optimization algorithm in deep learning uses local gradients to
perform numerous iterations in complex problems and find local
optimal solutions. I applied the same principles when designing the
iterative improvement process for the book’s quality. Similar to
determining initial parameters, we drafted the first edition of the
book on Overleaf. Then, we organized the content into a standard Git
code repository and established a mechanism to encourage readers and
community members to access issues and pull requests (PRs) on GitHub.
We also set up comprehensive book building tools, continuous
integration tools, and contributor seminars. This enabled us to
continually improve the book’s quality, aiming to achieve optimal
quality. It was akin to the outcome we achieve in machine learning by
following the SGD method.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High availability:</strong> We established a 24/7 online writing platform
for participants to develop the book and receive feedback from the
community in any time zone and language around the world. The Git
repository was hosted on GitHub and mirrored on Gitee to ensure high
availability of the writing platform.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Content neutralization:</strong> In a distributed system, the equal
treatment of each node is crucial for long-term operation, as it
allows for a unified approach to rectifying issues. Similarly, in
writing a book, we must anticipate potential challenges such as
outdated designs or the departure of writers, and mitigate them
through collaboration among participants from diverse backgrounds. We
emphasize the importance of creating neutral, objective, and
inclusive content and ensuring that any issues that arise do not
impede progress.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>## Current Situation and Future Outlook</p>
<p>With the established mechanism, writing progressed smoothly and more
participants joined the project. My former students Xiulong Yuan, Zihan
Ding, Yao Fu, Jie Ren, and Wenteng Liang were also dedicated to writing
and editing this book. Jiarong Han and Cheng Lai from Peng Cheng
Laboratory, along with numerous MindSpore developers all made
significant contributions to the book. Many senior designers of machine
learning systems also held discussions with us through various channels
and provided valuable feedback for the book. In addition, many academic
and industry top minds shared their thoughts with us. And worldwide,
talented students participated in writing. They included Jiankai Sun
from Stanford University, Peiyuan Liao from Carnegie Mellon University,
Hanchen Wang from Cambridge University, and Pei Mu from the University
of Edinburgh. Kaiyan Xiao, a machine learning expert from
GlaxoSmithKline PLC, also became one of the authors. Furthermore,
professors Peter Pietzuch from Imperial College London and Lei Chen from
Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, among others, provided
continuous writing advice to enhance the book’s quality.</p>
<p>After we implemented the “distributed system” for book writing, the
book’s quality has continually improved. When we released the book as an
open-source project, the number of participants rapidly increased,
coming as a major surprise to us. Driven by the open-source community,
the English and Chinese versions of the book have been advanced. This
was the first time that I realized the huge benefit of using the idea of
distributed systems and the knowledge of machine learning in solving
complex problems in real life.</p>
<p>A single tree is too weak to withstand a sandstorm. Similarly, it was
the forest of friends and the power of the community that gave us the
courage to take the very first and crucial step in writing this book. I
hope that this way of thinking can inspire and help in finding solutions
to other complex problems.</p>
